This is HardCaptcha, an "advanced math" captcha inspired by the captcha at the
Quantum Random Bit Generator Service registration procedure at
http://random.irb.hr/signup.php.

A live demo is available at http://bildungsresistenz.de/cgi/hardcaptcha

This currently is more a math trainer than a real captcha (since the output it plain
LaTeX rendered by the MathJax.js library, which can easily be parsed). It should
not be used in production, at least not in the current version.

Dependencies: a recent sympy version (tested with 0.6.2)
Installation: symlink hardcaptcha.cgi to your cgi-bin directory, and edit the paths
(mathjax library and shelve storage location)
